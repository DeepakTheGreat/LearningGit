1. Setup Git-

git init(On directory where one wants to enable git)

2. Make changes in the location where git was enabled. To view the changes-

git status

3. To commit the changes-

git add .
or
git add <file>

git commit -m "Comments"

Note: May need to set user name and user email, before doing commit.

4. Remove changes from stage-

git restore --staged filename

5. History of commits-

git log

6. Revert to earlier commit-

git reset <Commit Id>
Note: When using the above command, all the commits made after the commit to which we were reverting will be sent to the unstaged area.

7. Stashing changes-

#First we need to bring the file on stage
git add <filename>
#Now we can stash the changes
git stash <filename>

8. Bring changes back from stash-

git stash pop

9. Connecting remote repo to local repo-

#By convention name of all the repo/directory url in your personl git account is named origin.
git remote add origin <url>

10. View all url's linked to the repo.

git remote -v

11. Push changes to GitHub-

git push origin main

12. Branching-

#Never commit on main branch. Hence, we create branches for committing codes.
#Create Branch
git branch <branch name>

#Switch so that all commits are added to the branch
git checkout <branch name>

13. Merging branch to main code-

git merge <branch name>
